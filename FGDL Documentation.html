<strong><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</b></strong>
<table width="650">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
This dataset contains the Florida subset of the BTS' Intermodal Passenger Connectivity Database (IPCD), with data on the availability of connections among the various scheduled public transportation modes at each facility. The IPCD data covers the following types of passenger transportation terminals/stops: 1. Scheduled airline service airports. 2. Intercity bus stations (includes stations served by regular scheduled intercity bus service such as Greyhound, Trailways, code sharing buses such as Amtrak Thruway feeder buses, supplemental buses that provide additional frequencies along rail routes, and airport bus services from locations that are outside of the airport metropolitan area). 3. Intercity and transit ferry terminals. 4. Light-rail transit stations. 5. Heavy-rail transit stations. 6. Passenger-rail stations on the national rail network served by intercity rail and/or commuter rail services. 7. Bike-share stations belonging to bike-share systems that are open to the general public, IT-automated, and station based (contain hubs to which users can grab and return a bike) The data elements describe the location of the above types of terminals as well as the availability of intercity, commuter, and transit rail; scheduled air service; intercity and transit bus; intercity and transit ferry services; and bike-share availability.

<pre>The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'.
The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties
or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data
provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability
of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited
to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular

modifying, contributing or distributing the materials.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

<strong><b>DATA LINEAGE SUMMARY: </b></strong>

<table width="60%">

<pre>The GeoPlan Center took the following steps during the QA/QC process:
- Downloaded the dataset from BTS on 5/30/2019 using this link:
  https://data-usdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/intermodal-passenger-connectivity-database-ipcd
  (original dataset in shapefile format and in the WGS 1984 geographic
  coordinate system).
- Dataset projected into the FGDL Albers HPGN projection using
  WGS_1984_(ITRF00)_To_NAD_1983 + NAD_1983_To_HARN_Florida.
- Only features in Florida were desired, so a Select By Attribute was
  run and features with the STATE field equal to FL were
  selected. These features were exported to a new layer.
- DESCRIPT field added based on the FAC_NAME field. Any records with
  no data in the FAC_NAME field had their DESCRIPT field calculated as
  'NO DESCRIPT AVAILABLE'.
- ADDED MGRS, LAT_DD, LONG_DD, AND GOOGLEMAP FIELDS
- FGDLAQDATE field added based on the date the dataset was downloaded
  from source.
- The longest record for each field was found and field character lengths
  were shortened to the appropriate shortest length possible.
- Uppercased fields and appropriate records in the dataset.
- Layer name changed from Intermodal_Passenger_Connectivity_
  Database_IPCD.shp to bts_ipcd_2018.shp.
